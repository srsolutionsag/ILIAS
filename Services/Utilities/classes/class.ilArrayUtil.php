 * grown helper class with many different UseCases and functions. The class is not under direct maintainership and the
 * responsibilities are unclear. In this context, the class should no longer be used in the code and existing uses
 * should be converted to their own service in the medium term. If you need ilUtil for the implementation of a new
 * function in ILIAS > 7, please contact the Technical Board.
