/**
 * Deliver a resource of the ResourceStorage.
 *
 * The file is read through a consumer of the storage, which is the only
 * sanctioned way to get to the bytes of a resource. What comes out is the same
 * payload every other delivering activity produces - the shared
 * FilePayloadFactory of FileDelivery makes sure of that, so a consumer does not
 * have to care where a file was stored.
 *
 * ## Who may get what
 *
 * A resource identification says nothing about who may see the resource: that
 * is the business of whoever the resource belongs to - a file object, a badge, a
 * portfolio. This activity has no way of knowing, so it distinguishes two ways
 * of being used:
 *
 * - **Called from the outside** (`maybePerformAs()`, i.e. every REST request):
 *   a user only gets resources of their own, `owner id == user id`. Anything
 *   else would turn an unguessable id into the only protection of a file.
 * - **Called from another activity** (`perform()`): no check happens here. The
 *   calling activity knows what the resource belongs to and MUST check the
 *   access to that thing itself - see `ILIAS\File\Activities\DeliverFileObject`,
 *   which checks the read permission on the file object and then performs this
 *   activity.
